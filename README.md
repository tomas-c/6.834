# 6.834

## Compiling 
You'll need Bullet physics engine and Eigen math library. If using Linux, install libeigen3-dev and libbullet-dev. Locations of the library files are hardcoded in the CMakeLists.txt files. 

To compile
```
cd crrt
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
```

## Tests
There are a few tests. Executables should be generated under bin/tests/test_x. When running, the programs expect to be run in the same directory with their mesh files. Mesh files are in the models/ directory.

## Visualization in Blender

Blender model files are included in the models/ directory. The model files have a script that reads solution.txt file generated by the solver and animates the object that is currently selected.

## Visualization in V-REP

There is a V-REP file in models/vrep meant for visualizing a solution to the mousetrap problem. There is a script file attached to the Pipe model that takes solution.txt file and uses it to move the pipe and the 6-DOF robot arm. 

## Custom models and problems

To generate a new problem refer to either test_1 or test_2 source code. CollisionChecker class in test_2 is able to load Wavefront files (Y forward, Z up) and detect collisions between two objects (can be easily extended to more than 2).
